# Ubuntu 24.04

This example features deploying Ubuntu 24.04, a Linux distribution developed by Canonical. 

You don't have to use a custom image to deploy Ubuntu 24.04. You can use the default Ubuntu 24.04 image provided by Latitude.sh. 

However, this example can serve as a reference for how to create your own Ubuntu-based custom image.
